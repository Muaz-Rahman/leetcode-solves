# LeetCode Solves

## Repository to store my personal LC attempts for obvious nostalgic values

I am horrible at DSA problems. I have been running away from these abominations all my life. And now I am trying to face this fear because ~~I'm batman~~ unemployment is a problem.

Anyway, I will do my best to record the steps needed to easily trace the steps back to quickly understand the problems that I once solved and now I have forgotten because of course, these problems actually are useless in real software development and nobody would even bother with them if FAANG (It's MAANG now I think) didn't overhype this stupidity.
